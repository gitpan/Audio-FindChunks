Revision history for Perl extension Audio::FindChunks.

0.01  Fri Feb 20 16:03:06 2004
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-b 5.5.3 -Afn Audio::FindChunks -x wavestats

0.02	The lame reader was faulty; add --silent and an extra '-'.
	Reading from a pipe would fail (such as for MP3) due to sysread vs read
	Detection of a short read was wrong too...
	Allow caseless match of file types...
	Test that output_blocks(), output_levels() do not die too...
	Add mp3 split via MP3::Splitter.

0.03	End silence was erroneously subject to min_actual_silence_sec filter.
		Introduce new entries min_start_silence_sec,
		min_end_silence_sec, min_boundary_silence_sec.
	Examples of split_file().
	In documentation: change dependencies *_sec => *_chunks.
	(!!!) Uncompatible change to optional arguments of split_file().
	New parameter to output_blocks(); make output more machine-readable.
	Make set(), output_level(), output_blocks() return $self, thus
 		making them chainable: $self->set(...)->output_*()->....

0.04	Run test extraction twice (without/with tmp.rms).
	make `make clean' to clean test temporaries.
	Allow for shortsize > 2 and longsize > 4 starting with v5.6.0.
	Correct capitalization of dB in output_levels().
	Improve docs for output_levels(), output_blocks().
	Test could loop indefinitely due to while (--$c) done on an FP value.
	Set AUDIO_FH_TEST_UNLINK=0 in environment to keep the .wav file.

0.05	Use sysread() instead of <> to read RMS (gives better alignment).

0.06	Remove a spurious ";" in .xs.
	More 5.005-compatibility fixes (# in pack, => on separate line).
	More output_levels() examples.
	Protect output_levels(), output_blocks() against $\.
	New functions for sanity check of sizeof().
	Decrease the size of subchunk to 7KB.
	Add low-level debugging code.
	Correct off-by-one error in le_short_sample_stats().
