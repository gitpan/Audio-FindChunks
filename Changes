0.02	The lame reader was faulty; add --silent and an extra '-'.
	Reading from a pipe would fail (such as for MP3) due to sysread vs read
	Detection of a short read was wrong too...
	Allow caseless match of file types...
	Test that output_blocks(), output_levels() do not die too...
	Add mp3 split via MP3::Splitter.
